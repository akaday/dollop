# Step 6: Security Scanning

In this step, you will learn how to set up and run security vulnerability scans using tools like `npm audit` or `Snyk`. Security scanning helps you identify and address vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies.

## Setting up Security Scanning with npm audit

1. Ensure you have the latest version of npm installed:
   ```bash
   npm install -g npm
   ```

2. Run the npm audit command to scan for vulnerabilities:
   ```bash
   npm audit
   ```

3. Review the audit report and address any identified vulnerabilities by updating or replacing the affected packages.

## Setting up Security Scanning with Snyk

1. Install the Snyk CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g snyk
   ```

2. Authenticate with Snyk:
   ```bash
   snyk auth
   ```

3. Run the Snyk test command to scan for vulnerabilities:
   ```bash
   snyk test
   ```

4. Review the test report and address any identified vulnerabilities by updating or replacing the affected packages.

## Interpreting Scan Results

1. Review the scan results to identify any vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies.
2. Prioritize addressing high and critical severity vulnerabilities first.
3. Update or replace the affected packages to resolve the vulnerabilities.
4. Re-run the security scans to ensure that the vulnerabilities have been addressed.

By following these steps, you will be able to set up and run security vulnerability scans using npm audit or Snyk, and address any identified vulnerabilities in your project.
